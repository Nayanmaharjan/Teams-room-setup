# Microsoft Teams Room Setup (Onsite)

## Overview
This project documents the on-site setup of a Microsoft Teams Room for a business client.  
The purpose of the setup was to create a reliable, professional meeting room environment using Microsoft Teams, with clean cabling, stable connectivity, and properly configured audio and video devices.

This repository focuses on the **practical ICT support work** involved in setting up and validating a Teams Room environment rather than software development.
